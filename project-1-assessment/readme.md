# Project 1 Assessment: JS Counter

### GOAL

The goal of this final assessment was to create a counter that increases or decreases based on the input value.

### Instructions were to:
- Write HTML that provides the application's overall structure and content.
- Use CSS to provide styling.
- Use JavaScript to:
	- Define variables that hold application state, cache DOM elements, hold lookup data (constants), etc.
	- Select elements in the DOM.
	- Listen for browser events, such as `click`, being dispatched by DOM elements.
	- Manipulate a DOM element's content and style.

### DEMO-Mockup

### PROCESS

These were the steps I followed:

- **STEP 1 - Prepare and Plan**
- **STEP 2 - Set Up the App Using CSS/HTML**
- **STEP 3 - Implement the App's Requirements using Vanilla JS**
- **STEP 4 - Deploy to GitHub Pages**

I started with setting up my basic HTML and CSS styling using Flexbox. From there, I focused on click events in JS to increase and decrease in increments based on the text input number. I finished with styling to match the mockup and added a bonus to change the color when the number was negative.
