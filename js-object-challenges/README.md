### Pizza Parlor!
You've been tasked with making an app for a pizza parlor. You'll need an object to hold the menu data.

### 1. Make the Object
* Make a `menu` object with at least 5 pizza types as keys.
* Make each pizza value another nested object which contains a `toppings` key that is an array of at least 3 toppings and a `price` key telling what it costs.

### 2. Print the names of all Pizzas
* Using an appropriate Object method, print a list of all pizza names. (Hint: The pizza names are the keys in your object. Is there a way we can get a list of all keys in an object?)

### 3. Check for the existence of a special Pizza
* Using another appropriate Object method, check to see if the parlor offers a `banana` pizza. (Hint: Is there a method that can tell us whether or not an object contains a key of a certain name?)
