# Peudo-Code Tic Tac Toe

Next Week, you'll be building a [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game from scratch. To prepare, the deliverable this week is to plan it out! You'll also get to practice writing [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## The Assignment

Fork & Clone this repo. Open this file in your text editor and fill in the sections below. When you're done, make a pull request!

### Part 1: Make a To-Do list

Write out a list of *all* the things you need to do to code this game. This can be as detailed or high-level, though we recommend the former. This is your first time planning an app, so just have fun and just see what you can come up with. There's no right way.

<!-- 1. Create a 'board' that has 9 spots available - separate with lines between but not around
    //maybe use grid or flexbox? -->
2. Create two players (maybe an object, with properties for name and number of turns/pieces) - one player will be the computer and the other will have their name (each player should have at least 5 turns/pieces)
3. Allow human player to choose between x's and o's or assign a default choice for the human player versus the computer
4. Start the game by allowing the human player to choose which of the 9 spots to place their piece (remove that spot from the remaining available spots)
5. Lower the human player's number of turns/pieces by 1

    ///create a mechanism so that the computer's turn cannot be executed until the player has selected their piece's position

6. Set the computer to make a random choice of the remaining 8 available spots (function)
7. Lower the computer's number of turns/pieces by 1

    ///create a mechanism so that the player cannot choose their next position until the computer's turn has been run

8. Continue the process from steps 5-8 until the 9 spaces have been filled (DRAW function) or until the WIN function has been met
<!-- 9. Create the WIN function: If the human player places their pieces in a row of three (aligned horizontally, diagonally, or vertically) before the computer, the user wins
10. Create the DRAW function: if neither player places their pieces in a row of three (aligned horizontally, diagonally, or vertically), there is a draw -->
<!-- 11. Create an alert that pops up when one of the above applicable functions occurs ("Current Player WINS!" or "It's a draw") -->
12. Create a prompt for the human player to choose if they'd like to play again

### Optional Part 2: Pseudo-code your win-logic

Each time a player makes a move, your code will check to see if there is a game-over condition (a win or a draw). Write out this logic in english/psuedocode below. When you're done, anyone should be able to read your pseudo-code and translate it line-by-line into javascript or another language.

## Didn't have enough time to get to this optional part. Hoping we can cover this in class this week
