# Warm Up Exercise

## HTML Refresher

You'll be making an HTML page. Today, you'll work on the html. During the next warm up exercise you'll work on the css portion. If you need a quick refresher before you jump into coding, look back at the [HTML video on elements and media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhbnrDhWDdE&index=2&list=PLdnONIhPScST0Vy4LrIZiYKpFNoxgyH7J)

1) Make a `mockup` directory and create an html file for the blog site site. 
2) How do you add the boilerplate needed for an HTML file?
3) How do you add a title to the file so that you can see the name on the browser tab?


# Activity

## Directions
Look at the image below and create this webpage using HTML (no styling yet - we will do the CSS for this page during the next warm up exercise).

**IMPORTANT** Make sure to check your work in the browser *as you write your code*.

>:elephant: Reminder:<br>
Using the command `open index.html` inside the terminal when you are inside the folder with your `index.html` file will open your application in your browser.

## Plan before you code!
- Take a few minutes to describe what you see and figure out what tags you'll likely need

## The Mockup

## The Resources
1. URL for image: https://imgur.com/NzdTHeo.png
    - NOTE: This image is large! You'll have to resize it using CSS later on
 
1. Don't worry about matching the colors/fonts exactly, but in case you do want to try: 
     - The fonts were found on [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
     - Consider using a color picker to find the hex codes used in the mockup!
        - Macbooks come with an app called Digital Color Meter that you can use, or you can find a color picker online through google

1. For text to fill the paragraphs, there are a few ways to do this:
     - in your `.html` file type `lorem` and press tab to get some auto generated text by atom.
     - use [a standard Lorem Ipsum generator](http://www.lipsum.com/)
     - Want more flavor? Choose one from [this list](http://meettheipsums.com/)

1. The links that you create do not have to go anywhere, but you should be able to click on them.
    - Reminder!: Use a `#` to make a "dummy" link.
    
## Finished Outlining the HTML Early? 

1. Do another mockup!

2. Or, just move on to the hungry for more below

## Hungry for More?

1. Create an `about.html` file which has similar content to the index.  

2. Have the "About" link in the `index.html` file send you to `about.html`.

3. Have the "Home" link send you to the `index.html` page.

4. Add a `style.css` file, link it, and start styling the site to match the mockup as close as you can!
